# Part-1 Unemployment Rate Dataset

## Clustering
- K-Means Clustering: Partition countries into groups based on similarities in their unemployment data.

## Classification: classify countries into different categories based on unemployment rates (high, medium, low unemployment), convert the unemployment rate into a categorical variable and use classification algorithms:
- Random Forest Classifier: Classify data points into the defined unemployment categories based on the features.
Note: The choice of bins for categorizing the unemployment rate is subjective and heavily affect the model's performance.

## Model Optimizionï¼š To improve this machine learning model using the following enhancements:
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Balances the dataset if it's imbalanced.
- GridSearchCV: Searches for the best hyperparameters.
- Classification Report and Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed evaluation of the model's performance.
- Cross-Validation: Provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

## Interpretation and Assessment of Performance:
- The model's performance has improved from the first to the second part of the code, with accuracy increasing from 67% to 84%.
- The classification report indicates good precision and recall across all classes, which is further supported by strong F1-scores. This suggests the model is fairly accurate and balanced in predicting each class.
- The confusion matrix reveals some misclassifications, but the majority of predictions are correct, as seen in the high numbers along the diagonal.
- The cross-validation scores indicate a decent but somewhat varying performance across different parts of the dataset.

Overall, the model's performance can be considered good, especially in comparison to the initial model. However, there is always room for further tuning and improvement, particularly in addressing the variability indicated by the cross-validation scores. This could involve further hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or even collecting more data if possible.
